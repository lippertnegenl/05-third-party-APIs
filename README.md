This website is a calender that you can add events to.  The user can select a box within a given hour and add an event.  When that hour is current the box is highlighted in red and when the hour is past it is highlighted in white, and when the hour is in the future it is highlighted in green.   If the user enters text into the box and hits the save button the event is then saved-even if the user refreshes the page.  In order to delete an item from the box the user must press the save button after the item has been deleted othewise it will repopulate when the user refreshes the page.  

- As a creator is was fun building this webpage because we got to use day.js which is a great way of working with dates and times.  It was also educational to use a function that varied depending on what time it was.
